            <b>C++</b><br>
            I have been using C++ for over a year and a half, and have utilized it in both school projects, as well as personal projects that I created myself too. This is one of the languages I am most confortable with.

          <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>Python</b><br>
            I started using Python during my first year of engineering classes, but it was quickly replaced by C++. I however, got back to using it during my internship, and quickly learned specific libraries, such as <b><i>Pandas</i></b>, which is used for data analysis and data science. I also got more familiar with Python in relation with the <b><i>Django</i></b> framework, which is utlized to create robust web applications.

          <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>HTML</b><br>
            HTML was first used by me in my first website that I built during spring break of my sophomore year in college. I first learned using an app on my phone, but I learned a lot more once I got into building websites, and currently as I work on a web application.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>CSS</b><br>
            Like HTML, I learned CSS during my spring break vacation in my sophomore year of college. Learning this would really compliment what I knew about HTML as it would allow me to build much prettier and responisve websites.
          </li>
            <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>SQL</b><br>
            One of the many skills that I learned during my internship at Engie, was that of SQL. I was able to use this skill to communicate with company servers and add, delete, and create to that which was stored in the database.
          </li>
            <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>Circuit Design</b><br>
            My experience with circuit design stems from my electrical engineering classes, in which we learned <b><i>Verilog</i></b> and were able to code in Hardware Description Language and code individual circuits that we had. We also worked with <b><i>Breadboards</i></b> in order to build circuits ourselves.
