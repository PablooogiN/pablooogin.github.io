              the personal aspect as I had to communicate with clients and other developers with updates as they were achieved. This position allowed me to both exercise
              my technical skills, but also my intrapersonal skills, as well as my managerial skills, as I was in charge of keeping a team of developers updated with changes
              and updates that needed to take place.

            <b>C++</b><br>
            I have been using C++ for over a year and a half, and have utilized it in both school projects, as well as personal projects that I created myself too. This is one of the languages I am most confortable with.

            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>Python</b><br>
            I started using Python during my first year of engineering classes, but it was quickly replaced by C++. I however, got back to using it during my internship, and quickly learned specific libraries, such as <b><i>Pandas</i></b>, which is used for data analysis and data science. I also got more familiar with Python in relation with the <b><i>Django</i></b> framework, which is utlized to create robust web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>HTML</b><br>
            HTML was first used by me in my first website that I built during spring break of my sophomore year in college. I first learned using an app on my phone, but I learned a lot more once I got into building websites, and currently as I work on a web application.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>CSS</b><br>
            Like HTML, I learned CSS during my spring break vacation in my sophomore year of college. Learning this would really compliment what I knew about HTML as it would allow me to build much prettier and responisve websites.
          </li>
            <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>SQL</b><br>
            One of the many skills that I learned during my internship at Engie, was that of SQL. I was able to use this skill to communicate with company servers and add, delete, and create to that which was stored in the database.
          </li>
            <li>
            <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
            <b>Circuit Design</b><br>
            My experience with circuit design stems from my electrical engineering classes, in which we learned <b><i>Verilog</i></b> and were able to code in Hardware Description Language and code individual circuits that we had. We also worked with <b><i>Breadboards</i></b> in order to build circuits ourselves.
